This project is to create an automated light for my apartment
it will use a HC-SR04 to get the hand wave gesture in front of the sensor
the sensor is also connnected to a arduino nano for control
the arduino is used to control the lights of a WS2812


Issues:
	currently I am running into issues because the sensor and lights won't work together
		I believe that the timing of the sensor is messing with the PWM of the lights
